Flight Delays Prediction (Machine Learning at Scale)  
A notebook (ran on Databricks) detailing the process of exploratory data analysis, data pre-processing, feature engineering, joining data, and training and tuning machine learning models. 
John's primary focus was on processing more than 30 million flights and 630 million weather raw data (including feature creations) into machine learning ready datasets.
